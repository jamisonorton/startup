# This is my notes file using a first level heading

I have learned that there is many ways that we can improve the md files and how important it is to write clear md files so those using your project can also read it.

Since I am the CSR in the Statistics Department most of the HTML and HTTPS setup things I already knew. Caddy makes it way too easy to get a Let's Encrypt cert.

Though I haven't used AWS before I am excited to try it out as we have been wondering if we should move to AWS for one of the stat classes. We have been worried about making the students pay for their server so instead we have just created docker instances for them to "act" like they have an AWS environment, but depending on how much money I spend this semester we might migrate to AWS to give the students a true AWS experience.

I have created many websites in the past but mostly I use plain HTML and CSS to do that. I have not actually implemented JavaScript. We also have been working on integrating Next.JS as our JavaScript framework of choice for the department. So I am using this class to brush up on my HTML and CSS but to really deep dive into JS and get ready for the changes we are making in the department.

# Notes for HTML deliverable

Creating basic webpages is pretty easy. I am excited to start working on the css to make it a bit more readable and pretty. I also have a question about if I can use next.js instead of react to quickly implement routers and to focus my learning and engineering on the technology that I plan on using for my department.

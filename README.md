## Startup Pitch

I would like to create a website for my wife's piano lessons business. Outlined below are how each technology is going to be implemented in the site.

- **HTML** - I will be creating four pages using correct HTML structure. The pages are as follows: Home, About, Calendar and login.
- **CSS** - My site will use styling that will look good on a variety of devices and have good color choices and contrast.
- **JavaScript** - Provides login, and functionality to the various landing pages.
- **React** - Multi-paged application with views componentized and reactive to user's actions.
- **Web service** - functions for a signup button to schedule the first lesson. I also want to implement the google calendar api to show her calendar which will have an appointment scheduler for the students to chose their lesson spot.
- **Authentication**: This site will require authentication in order to access or view landing pages other than home.
- **Database data**: We will have a database containing the books that are recommended to students based off of years of playing.
- **WebSocket data**: We will want a way to update students with important information so push notifications will be used for new messages or critical events such as needing to miss a day of appointments.

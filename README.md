## Startup Pitch

I would like to create a website for my wife's piano lessons business. Outlined below are how each technology is going to be implemented in the site.

- **HTML** - I will be creating four pages using correct HTML structure. The pages are as follows: Home, About, Calendar and login.
- **CSS** - My site will use styling that will look good on a variety of devices and have good color choices and contrast.
- **JavaScript** - Provides login, and functionality to the various landing pages.
- **React** - Multi-paged application with views componentized and reactive to user's actions.
- **Web service** - functions for a signup button to schedule the first lesson. I also want to implement the google calendar api to show her calendar which will have an appointment scheduler for the students to chose their lesson spot.
- **Authentication**: This site will require authentication in order to access or view landing pages other than home.
- **Database data**: We will have a database containing the books that are recommended to students based off of years of playing.
- **WebSocket data**: We will want a way to update students with important information so push notifications will be used for new messages or critical events such as needing to miss a day of appointments.

## Example Home Page

## Startup HTML Deliverable

- **Simon** - I have copied the simon-html directory into my startup repository. I have also copied the deployFiles.sh script into my startup directory and used it to copy all of my html pages to my aws server.
- **Github** - I have also linked my github repository in the body of my index page so it is the 2nd thing you can read. I plan on adding this lower on the page in the footer section later. I have also committed over several days to show that I have ownership of my code to avoid rejection of my submission.
- **Startup** - I have added several landing pages and included them in an unorginized list. They will eventually be fixed with the css when I get to it for a proper navbar.
- **HTML_Pages** - I have included 4 html pages. The homepage, about, calendar, and login pages. These will be used as the main landing pages on my application.
- **HTML_Tags** - I have included all of the required HTML tags
